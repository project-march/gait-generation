# Code Style
For code style the [pep8 style guide rules](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) are followed.
To check these rules we use the [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) tool and [`pep8-naming`](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/) plugin.
To install run

    python2 -m pip install flake8 pep8-naming --user
    
Then you can run `flake8` from the root and it will give errors you should fix, otherwise the Travis build will fail.
